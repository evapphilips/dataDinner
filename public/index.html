                                <h4>Setting the Table is an experiment aimed to help communities engage in difficult, but substantive and meaningful conversations.  This project is largely inspired by the types of conversations I was exposed to growing up around my dinner table.  On Sunday evenings I would set the table as my parents prepared a meal for family and friends.  While I set the table for these dinner parties I would excitedly anticipate the connections and conversations that developed every week around the dinner table.  Inspired by my own table, my hope for this project was to bring communities together to engage in comfortable, honest conversations similar to the conversations we have around our dinner tables.  Setting the Table hopes to empower everyone to make their voice heard and explore similarities and differences with others.</h4>

                                <h4>Setting the Table is a facilitation tool meant to guide communities through thoughtful and comfortable conversations.  First, participants are asked to prepare their plate.  Here participants answer a series of questions that guide them to reflect on the topic.  This step is meant to provide an opportunity for individuals to come to the conversation prepared with their own ideas and biases.  Before engaging in any conversation it is valuable to reflect first, internally.  As each onboarding question is answered, a visual element is added to your virtual dinner plate.  This plate will help to anonymize each participant during the discussion.  On the day of the conversation, participants will all join the table by setting their plate on the virtual table.  A facilitator will pose multiple choice questions to the group and each participant can move their virtual plate to indicate their answer.  These polls guide the discussion and build a layer of data on top of the conversation.  They allow everyone to participate, and create new ways for individuals to share their opinions.  Participants are also encouraged to submit questions to the facilitator so that participants can direct the conversation themselves. </h4>

                                <h4>Setting the Table aims to promote honest conversations.  Thus, we allow for individuals to answer questions anonymously and voice their opinions when they feel comfortable.  We ask participants to provide a username such that their plate can be matched to their answers.  However, a participant's username is distinctly not recorded when participants ask or answer questions. The goal is to provide a space for individuals to express themselves honestly and to the extent they are comfortable with, thus keeping your input anonymous is our prime concern.</h4>
